      <div id="6-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">6.</a>&nbsp;There was a man sent from God, whose name was

      <div id="8-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">8.</a>&nbsp;He was not the light, but came to bear
        witness about the light.</div>
      <div id="9-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">9.</a>&nbsp;The true light, which gives light to
        everyone, was coming into the world.</div>
      <div id="10-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">10.</a>&nbsp;He was in the world, and the world was made
        through him, yet the world did not know him.</div>
      <div id="11-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">11.</a>&nbsp;He came to his own, and his own people did
        not receive him.</div>
      <div id="12-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">12.</a>&nbsp;But to all who did receive him, who
        believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</div>

      <div id="14-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">14.</a>&nbsp;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among
        us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</div>
      <div id="15-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">15.</a>&nbsp;(John bore witness about him, and cried

      <div id="16-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">16.</a>&nbsp;For from his fullness we have all received,

      <div id="17-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">17.</a>&nbsp;For the law was given through Moses; grace
        and truth came through Jesus Christ.</div>

      <h5>The Testimony of John the Baptist</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="19-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">19.</a>&nbsp;And this is the testimony of John, when the
        Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</div>
      <div id="20-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">20.</a>&nbsp;He confessed, and did not deny, but
        confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</div>
      <div id="21-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">21.</a>&nbsp;And they asked him, “What then? Are you
        Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”</div>
      <div id="22-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">22.</a>&nbsp;So they said to him, “Who are you? We need
        to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</div>
      <div id="23-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">23.</a>&nbsp;He said, “I am the voice of one crying out
        in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
      </div>
      <div id="24-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">24.</a>&nbsp;(Now they had been sent from the
        Pharisees.)</div>
      <div id="25-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">25.</a>&nbsp;They asked him, “Then why are you
        baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</div>
      <div id="26-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">26.</a>&nbsp;John answered them, “I baptize with water,
        but among you stands one you do not know,</div>
      <div id="27-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">27.</a>&nbsp;even he who comes after me, the strap of
        whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”</div>
      <div id="28-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">28.</a>&nbsp;These things took place in Bethany across
        the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</div>

      <h5>Behold, the Lamb of God</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="29-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">29.</a>&nbsp;The next day he saw Jesus coming toward
        him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</div>
      <div id="30-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">30.</a>&nbsp;This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes
        a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ </div>
      <div id="31-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">31.</a>&nbsp;I myself did not know him, but for this
        purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”</div>
      <div id="32-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">32.</a>&nbsp;And John bore witness: “I saw the Spirit
        descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.</div>
      <div id="33-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">33.</a>&nbsp;I myself did not know him, but he who sent
        me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes
        with the Holy Spirit.’</div>
      <div id="34-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">34.</a>&nbsp;And I have seen and have borne witness that
        this is the Son of God.”</div>

    </div>

      <div id="35-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">35.</a>&nbsp;The next day again John was standing with
        two of his disciples,</div>
      <div id="36-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">36.</a>&nbsp;and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and
        said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”</div>
      <div id="37-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">37.</a>&nbsp;The two disciples heard him say this, and
        they followed Jesus.</div>
      <div id="38-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">38.</a>&nbsp;Jesus turned and saw them following and
        said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you
        staying?”</div>
      <div id="39-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">39.</a>&nbsp;He said to them, “Come and you will see.”
        So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.

      <div id="40-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">40.</a>&nbsp;One of the two who heard John speak and

      <div id="41-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">41.</a>&nbsp;He first found his own brother Simon and
        said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).</div>
      <div id="42-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">42.</a>&nbsp;He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at
