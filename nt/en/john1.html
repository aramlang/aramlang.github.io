      <div id="1-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v1">1.</a></span>&nbsp;In the beginning
        was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</div>
      <div id="2-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v2">2.</a></span>&nbsp;He was in the
        beginning with God.</div>
      <div id="3-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v3">3.</a></span>&nbsp;All things were
        made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</div>
      <div id="4-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v4">4.</a></span>&nbsp;In him was life,
        and the life was the light of men.</div>
      <div id="5-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v5">5.</a></span>&nbsp;The light shines in
        the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</div>
      <div id="6-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v6">6.</a></span>&nbsp;There was a man
        sent from God, whose name was John.</div>
      <div id="7-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v7">7.</a></span>&nbsp;He came as a
        witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him.</div>
      <div id="8-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v8">8.</a></span>&nbsp;He was not the
        light, but came to bear witness about the light.</div>
      <div id="9-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v9">9.</a></span>&nbsp;The true light,
        which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.</div>
      <div id="10-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v10">10.</a></span>&nbsp;He was in the
        world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.</div>
      <div id="11-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v11">11.</a></span>&nbsp;He came to his
        own, and his own people did not receive him.</div>
      <div id="12-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v12">12.</a></span>&nbsp;But to all who
        did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</div>
      <div id="13-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v13">13.</a></span>&nbsp;who were born,

      <div id="14-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v14">14.</a></span>&nbsp;And the Word
        became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of
        grace and truth.</div>
      <div id="15-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v15">15.</a></span>&nbsp;(John bore
        witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because
        he was before me.’”)</div>
      <div id="16-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v16">16.</a></span>&nbsp;For from his

      <div id="17-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v17">17.</a></span>&nbsp;For the law was
        given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</div>
      <div id="18-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v18">18.</a></span>&nbsp;No one has ever
        seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.</div>

    <div class="text">
      <div id="19-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v19">19.</a></span>&nbsp;And this is the
        testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</div>
      <div id="20-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v20">20.</a></span>&nbsp;He confessed,
        and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”</div>
      <div id="21-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v21">21.</a></span>&nbsp;And they asked
        him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”</div>
      <div id="22-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v22">22.</a></span>&nbsp;So they said to
        him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</div>
      <div id="23-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v23">23.</a></span>&nbsp;He said, “I am
        the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
      </div>
      <div id="24-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v24">24.</a></span>&nbsp;(Now they had
        been sent from the Pharisees.)</div>
      <div id="25-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v25">25.</a></span>&nbsp;They asked him,
        “Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</div>
      <div id="26-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v26">26.</a></span>&nbsp;John answered
        them, “I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,</div>
      <div id="27-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v27">27.</a></span>&nbsp;even he who
        comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”</div>
      <div id="28-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v28">28.</a></span>&nbsp;These things
        took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</div>

      <h5>Behold, the Lamb of God</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="29-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v29">29.</a></span>&nbsp;The next day he
        saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</div>
      <div id="30-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v30">30.</a></span>&nbsp;This is he of
        whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’ </div>
      <div id="31-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v31">31.</a></span>&nbsp;I myself did not
        know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”</div>
      <div id="32-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v32">32.</a></span>&nbsp;And John bore
        witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.</div>
      <div id="33-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v33">33.</a></span>&nbsp;I myself did not
        know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and
        remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</div>
      <div id="34-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v34">34.</a></span>&nbsp;And I have seen
        and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”</div>

      <div id="35-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v35">35.</a></span>&nbsp;The next day
        again John was standing with two of his disciples,</div>
      <div id="36-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v36">36.</a></span>&nbsp;and he looked at
        Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”</div>
      <div id="37-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v37">37.</a></span>&nbsp;The two
        disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</div>
      <div id="38-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v38">38.</a></span>&nbsp;Jesus turned and
        saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means
        Teacher), “where are you staying?”</div>
      <div id="39-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v39">39.</a></span>&nbsp;He said to them,
        “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it
        was about the tenth hour.</div>
      <div id="40-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v40">40.</a></span>&nbsp;One of the two
        who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</div>
      <div id="41-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v41">41.</a></span>&nbsp;He first found
        his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).</div>
      <div id="42-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v42">42.</a></span>&nbsp;He brought him
        to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means
        Peter).</div>

          Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”</div>
        <div id="44-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v44">44.</a></span>&nbsp;Now Philip was

        <div id="45-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v45">45.</a></span>&nbsp;Philip found
          Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of

        <div id="46-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v46">46.</a></span>&nbsp;Nathanael said

        <div id="47-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v47">47.</a></span>&nbsp;Jesus saw

        <div id="48-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v48">48.</a></span>&nbsp;Nathanael said
          to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree,
          I saw you.”</div>
        <div id="49-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v49">49.</a></span>&nbsp;Nathanael

        <div id="50-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v50">50.</a></span>&nbsp;Jesus answered

        <div id="51-1"><span class="verseno"><a href="#header" title="Go Up" id="v51">51.</a></span>&nbsp;And he said to
