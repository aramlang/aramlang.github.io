    <div class="text">
      <div id="1-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">1.</a>&nbsp;On the third day there was a wedding at Cana
        in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</div>
      <div id="2-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">2.</a>&nbsp;Jesus also was invited to the wedding with
        his disciples.</div>
      <div id="3-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">3.</a>&nbsp;When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus
        said to him, “They have no wine.”</div>
      <div id="4-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">4.</a>&nbsp;And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does this
        have to do with me? My hour has not yet come.”</div>
      <div id="5-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">5.</a>&nbsp;His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever
        he tells you.”</div>
      <div id="6-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">6.</a>&nbsp;Now there were six stone water jars there for
        the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</div>
      <div id="7-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">7.</a>&nbsp;Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars
        with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.</div>
      <div id="8-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">8.</a>&nbsp;And he said to them, “Now draw some out and
        take it to the master of the feast.” So they took it.</div>
      <div id="9-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">9.</a>&nbsp;When the master of the feast tasted the water
        now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the
        master of the feast called the bridegroom</div>
      <div id="10-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">10.</a>&nbsp;and said to him, “Everyone serves the good
        wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”
      </div>
      <div id="11-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">11.</a>&nbsp;This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at
        Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</div>
      <div id="12-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">12.</a>&nbsp;After this he went down to Capernaum, with
        his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.</div>

      <h5>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="13-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">13.</a>&nbsp;The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and
        Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</div>
      <div id="14-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">14.</a>&nbsp;In the temple he found those who were
        selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.</div>
      <div id="15-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">15.</a>&nbsp;And making a whip of cords, he drove them
        all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned
        their tables.</div>
      <div id="16-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">16.</a>&nbsp;And he told those who sold the pigeons,
        “Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade.”</div>
      <div id="17-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">17.</a>&nbsp;His disciples remembered that it was
        written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</div>
      <div id="18-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">18.</a>&nbsp;So the Jews said to him, “What sign do you
        show us for doing these things?”</div>
      <div id="19-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">19.</a>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple,
        and in three days I will raise it up.”</div>
      <div id="20-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">20.</a>&nbsp;The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six
        years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?”</div>
      <div id="21-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">21.</a>&nbsp;But he was speaking about the temple of his
        body.</div>
      <div id="22-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">22.</a>&nbsp;When therefore he was raised from the dead,
        his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had
        spoken.</div>

      <h5>Jesus Knows What Is in Man</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="23-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">23.</a>&nbsp;Now when he was in Jerusalem at the
        Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. </div>
      <div id="24-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">24.</a>&nbsp;But Jesus on his part did not entrust
        himself to them, because he knew all people</div>
      <div id="25-1"><a class="no" href="#header" title="Go Up">25.</a>&nbsp;and needed no one to bear witness about
        man, for he himself knew what was in man.</div>
