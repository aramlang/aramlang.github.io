      <h5>You Must Be Born Again</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="1-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">1.</a>&nbsp;Now there was a man of the Pharisees named
        Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</div>
      <div id="2-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">2.</a>&nbsp;This man came to Jesus by night and said
        to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless
        God is with him.”</div>
      <div id="3-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">3.</a>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to
        you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</div>
      <div id="4-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">4.</a>&nbsp;Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born
        when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?”</div>
      <div id="5-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">5.</a>&nbsp;Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you,
        unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</div>
      <div id="6-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">6.</a>&nbsp;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and
        that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</div>
      <div id="7-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">7.</a>&nbsp;Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must
        be born again.’</div>
      <div id="8-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">8.</a>&nbsp;The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear
        its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the
        Spirit.” </div>
      <div id="9-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">9.</a>&nbsp;Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things
        be?”</div>
      <div id="10-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">10.</a>&nbsp;Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of
        Israel and yet you do not understand these things?</div>
      <div id="11-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">11.</a>&nbsp;Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of
        what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony.</div>
      <div id="12-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">12.</a>&nbsp;If I have told you earthly things and you
        do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</div>
      <div id="13-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">13.</a>&nbsp;No one has ascended into heaven except he
        who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.</div>
      <div id="14-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">14.</a>&nbsp;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
        wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</div>
      <div id="15-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">15.</a>&nbsp;that whoever believes in him may have
        eternal life.</div>

      <h5>For God So Loved the World</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="16-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">16.</a>&nbsp;“For God so loved the world, that he gave
        his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</div>
      <div id="17-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">17.</a>&nbsp;For God did not send his Son into the world
        to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</div>
      <div id="18-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">18.</a>&nbsp;Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
        but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of
        God.</div>
      <div id="19-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">19.</a>&nbsp;And this is the judgment: the light has
        come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.</div>
      <div id="20-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">20.</a>&nbsp;For everyone who does wicked things hates
        the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.</div>
      <div id="21-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">21.</a>&nbsp;But whoever does what is true comes to the
        light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.”</div>

      <h5>John the Baptist Exalts Christ</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <div id="22-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">22.</a>&nbsp;After this Jesus and his disciples went
        into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing.</div>
      <div id="23-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">23.</a>&nbsp;John also was baptizing at Aenon near
        Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized</div>
      <div id="24-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">24.</a>&nbsp;(for John had not yet been put in prison).
      </div>
      <div id="25-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">25.</a>&nbsp;Now a discussion arose between some of
        John's disciples and a Jew over purification.</div>
      <div id="26-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">26.</a>&nbsp;And they came to John and said to him,
        “Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness—look, he is baptizing, and all are going
        to him.”</div>
      <div id="27-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">27.</a>&nbsp;John answered, “A person cannot receive
        even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.</div>
      <div id="28-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">28.</a>&nbsp;You yourselves bear me witness, that I
        said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.’</div>
      <div id="29-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">29.</a>&nbsp;The one who has the bride is the
        bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.
        Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.</div>
      <div id="30-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">30.</a>&nbsp;He must increase, but I must decrease.”
      </div>
      <div id="31-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">31.</a>&nbsp;He who comes from above is above all. He
        who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all.
      </div>
      <div id="32-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">32.</a>&nbsp;He bears witness to what he has seen and
        heard, yet no one receives his testimony.</div>
      <div id="33-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">33.</a>&nbsp;Whoever receives his testimony sets his
        seal to this, that God is true.</div>
      <div id="34-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">34.</a>&nbsp;For he whom God has sent utters the words
        of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.</div>
      <div id="35-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">35.</a>&nbsp;The Father loves the Son and has given all
        things into his hand.</div>
      <div id="36-1"><a class="no" href="#up" title="Go Up">36.</a>&nbsp;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal
        life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</div>
