<td width="100%">WHEN Solomon, the son of David, became king of Israel in 1037 B.C.E., he
prayed to Jehovah for &quot;wisdom and knowledge&quot; to &quot;judge this great people.&quot; In response,
Jehovah gave him 'knowledge and wisdom and an understanding heart.' (2 Chron. 1:10-12; 1 Ki. 3:12;
4:30, 31) As a result, Solomon came to &quot;speak three thousand proverbs.&quot; (1 Ki. 4:32) Some of
this spoken wisdom was recorded in the Bible book of Proverbs. Since his wisdom was really that which 
&quot;God had put in
his heart,&quot; then in studying Proverbs we are in fact studying the wisdom of Jehovah God. (1 Ki. 10:23,
24) These proverbs sum up eternal truths. They are just as up-to-date now as when they were first uttered.<br>
<br>
The reign of Solomon was an appropriate time for providing this divine guidance. Solomon was said to
&quot;sit upon Jehovah's throne.&quot; The theocratic kingdom of Israel was at its height, and Solomon was favored with
surpassing &quot;royal dignity.&quot; (1 Chron. 29:23, 25) It was a time of peace and
plenty, a time of security. (1 Ki. 4:20-25) However, even under that theocratic rule,
the people still had their personal problems and difficulties due to human imperfections. That the
people would look to wise King Solomon to help them solve their problems is understandable. (1
Ki. 3:16-28) In the course of pronouncing judgment in these many cases, he uttered proverbial sayings that
fitted the many circumstances of life arising from day to day. These brief but impressive sayings were
greatly treasured by those who desired to regulate their lives in accordance with the will of
God.<br>
<br>
The record does not say that Solomon wrote the Proverbs. However, it says that he 
'spoke' proverbs,
also that &quot;he . . . made a thorough search, that he might arrange many proverbs in order,&quot; thus showing
that he had an interest in preserving proverbs for later use. (1 Ki. 4:32; Eccl. 12:9) In
the time of David and Solomon, there were official secretaries in the lists of
court officials. (2 Sam. 20:25; 2 Ki. 12:10) Whether these scribes in his court wrote and
collected his proverbs, we do not know, but the expressions of any ruler of his caliber would be
highly regarded and would normally be recorded. It is generally agreed that the book is a collection
compiled from other collections.<br>
<br>
The book of Proverbs may be divided into five sections. These are:<br>
<br>

<td width="401" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Chapter 31, which comprises &quot;The words of Lemuel the king, the weighty message that his

<p>Solomon was thus the originator of the bulk of the proverbs. As to Agur and Lemuel, nothing definite is known about their identity. Some commentators suggest that Lemuel may
have been another name for Solomon.<br><br>
When was Proverbs written and compiled? The greater part was no doubt written down during Solomon's reign
(1037-998 B.C.E.) before his deflection. Because of uncertainty as to the identity of Agur and Lemuel, it
is not possible to date their material. Since one of the collections was made in the reign of Hezekiah
(745-717 B.C.E.), it could not have been before his reign that the final collecting was done. Were the
last two divisions also collected under King Hezekiah's purview? In answer there is an illuminating
footnote to Proverbs 31:31 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures - With References:
&quot;Some ed[itions] of the Heb[rew] text display the trigrammaton, or three letters, Chehth, Za'yin, Qohph
(*qzx) that stand as King Hezekiah's signature to the copy-work done by his 
scribes to signify that the work had been completed.&quot;<br><br>
In Hebrew Bibles the book was first called by the opening word in the book,
mish-leh', meaning &quot;proverbs.&quot; Mish-leh' is the plural number, construct state, of the Hebrew noun ma-shal', which noun is
generally thought to be derived from a root word meaning &quot;be like&quot; or &quot;be comparable.&quot; These terms
nicely describe the contents of the book, for proverbs are pithy sayings that often employ likenesses or
comparisons and that are designed to make the hearer think. The brief form of the proverbs makes them easy
to follow and interesting, and in this form they are easily taught, learned, and remembered. The idea sticks.<br><br>
The style of expression in the book is also most interesting. It is in Hebrew poetic style. The
structure of most of the book is parallel poetry. This does not make the ends of lines or verses rhyme, or
sound alike. It consists of making rhythmic lines give parallel thoughts or ideas. Its beauty and power
of instruction lie in this thought rhythm. The thoughts may be synonymous or contrasting, but the power of the
parallel is there to give extension to the thought, to enlarge upon the idea, and to make sure of conveying
the meaning in the thought. Examples of the synonymous parallelism are to be found at Proverbs 11:25; 16:18;
and 18:15, and examples of the more abundant contrasting parallelism at Proverbs 10:7, 30; 12:25;
13:25; and 15:8. Another type of structure is found right at the end of the book.
(Prov. 31:10-31) The 22 verses there are arranged so that in Hebrew each one begins with the succeeding letter of the Hebrew
alphabet, this being the acrostic style that is used also in a number of the psalms. For beauty
this style has no parallel in ancient writings.&nbsp;<br><br>
The authenticity of Proverbs is also shown in the wide use made of the book by the early Christians in
stating rules of conduct. James was apparently very familiar with Proverbs and used its basic principles
in the fine counsel he gave for Christian conduct. (Compare Proverbs 14:29; 17:27
with James 1:19, 20; Proverbs 3:34 with James 4:6; Proverbs 27:1 with James 4:13, 14.) Direct quotations from Proverbs are also to
be found in the following passages: Romans 12:20 - Proverbs 25:21, 22; Hebrews 12:5,
6 - Proverbs 3:11, 12; 2 Peter 2:22 - Proverbs 26:11.<br><br>
In addition, Proverbs shows itself to be in harmony with the rest of the Bible, thus proving it to be a
part of &quot;all Scripture.&quot; It presents striking unity of thought when compared with the Law of Moses, Jesus'
teaching, and the writings of Jesus' disciples and apostles.<br>
(See Proverbs 10:16 - 1 Corinthians 15:58 and Galatians 6:8, 9; Proverbs 12:25 - Matthew 6:25;
Proverbs 20:20 - Exodus 20:12 and Matthew 15:4.) Even when touching on such points as the readying of the
earth for human habitation, there is oneness of thinking with other Bible writers. - Prov. 3:19, 20;
Gen. 1:6, 7; Job 38:4-11; Ps. 104:5-9.<br><br>
Also testifying to the book's divine inspiration is its scientific accuracy, whether the proverb involves
chemical, medical, or health principles. Proverbs 25:20 apparently tells of acid-alkali reactions.
Proverbs 31:4, 5 agrees with modern scientific findings that alcohol dulls the thinking
processes. Many doctors and nutritionists agree that honey is a healthful food, calling to mind the proverb: 
&quot;My son,
eat honey, for it is good.&quot; (Prov. 24:13) Modern observations on psychosomatics are not new to
Proverbs. &quot;A heart that is joyful does good as a curer.&quot; - 17:22; 15:17.<br>
<br>
Indeed, so completely does the book of Proverbs cover every human need and situation that one
authority stated:
